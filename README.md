# Assignment #1 - Chat App With Node, Express, and Vue

I will be using NodeJS, Express and Vue with Socket.io to create a live interactive chat application. I'm also going to include a notification message when a user leaves the chat.

## Installing and running app

Run the web app after cloning it into any directory with `cd`. You can also download the app by going to the repo, clicking the green button that says "Code," and clicking on "Download ZIP."

## How to use Project

Connect to the chat service via localhost and chat away!

Enjoy!
